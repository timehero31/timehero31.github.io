								<p style="text-align: justify;font-family:Bell MT;font-size:20px;width:400px;float:left"> Helicopters follow the same basic
									aerodynamic principles as airplanes. Like
									plane wings, a helicopter’s blades are
									airfoils: curved on the top and flatter on the
									bottom. This shape generates lift by changing the
									pressure and direction of the air that flows over it.
									While planes use engines to drive forward and
									get air rushing over the wings,
									helicopters rapidly spin their motors.
									The pilot has command over this
									system using two control levers: one
									controls lift by tilting the blades and the other
									steers the helicopter by swivelling them.
									Helicopters also have a tail rotor that counteracts
									the thrust of the main rotor, preventing the
									fuselage from spinning, maintaining
									forward momentum and keeping the
									helicopter stable.

								<p style="text-align: justify;font-family:Bell MT;font-size:20px;width:400px;float:left"> Every object emits or absorbs
										thermal radiation. And
										although we can sense it with
										our skin, we’re unable to see it with
										our eyes. Infrared radiation falls just
										outside of our visible spectrum, but
										possessing the ability to see
										temperature would undoubtedly be
										of huge benefit to humans in certain
										situations. Fortunately though, we
										now have thermography, which can
										convert these invisible waves into
										visible light.
										Devices that are capable of
										translating infrared waves into
										colours that we can see operate very
										similarly, but also distinctly, from
										video cameras. Rather than glass –
										which infrared radiation struggles to
										penetrate – infrared cameras use a
										material called germanium for their
										lenses. This allows infrared waves to
										pass through into detectors, which
										relay the radiation as information to
										sensor electronics. The information
										is then transformed into a scale of
										visible colours, which are directly
										proportional to the temperature that
										the object is emitting.
										Thermographs can be used for
										many practical applications. These
										include a noninvasive way of
										monitoring electricity and power
										lines for overheating and other
										issues, analysing bodies in forensics
										and detecting the enemy during war.
										Firefighters even use it to see through
										smoke and find people.

								<h1 class="entry-title">Is Li-Fi the Future ? </h1>

								<p style="text-align: justify;font-family:Bell MT;font-size:20px;width:450px;float:left"> Li-Fi is like Wi-Fi except it uses visible light
										to send and receive data, instead of radio
										waves. Light and radio waves are just
										different frequency ranges in the same
										electromagnetic spectrum, but using light waves
										has some big advantages. First, the visible light
										range of the spectrum is 10,000 times bigger than
										the entire radio spectrum, and Wi-Fi is restricted
										to a tiny slice of that. So Li-Fi can fit more data
										into its signal. Speeds of up to one gigabit per
										second have been reached in real-world tests,
										with greater speeds achieved in the lab. Li-Fi is
										cheap too; it uses simple LEDs to broadcast data
										by flickering them on and off so rapidly that, to
										the human eye, they don’t even appear to be lit.
										The range of Li-Fi is much shorter than Wi-Fi,
										as it won’t travel through walls or floors, but this
										improves security because it is much harder for a
										hacker to eavesdrop on your signal. Homes and
										offi ces can be fitted with a cheap repeater in
										every light socket, and the signal works after
										bouncing off walls and furniture, so it doesn’t
										need a direct line of sight.
										Li-Fi won’t replace mobile phone technologies
										like 4G, or the microwave wireless links used to
										connect buildings, but its speed, low cost and
										security could make ordinary Wi-Fi redundant
