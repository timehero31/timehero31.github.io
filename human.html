												sensory receptors) to tell the difference
												between pressure and pain, hot and cold,
												and a light brush versus a hard poke. These
												receptors are specially adapted nerve endings,
												and many are wrapped in layers of tissue, helping
												them to function in various ways. They are located
												in different numbers across your body, with more
												in your hands, feet and lips than anywhere else.
												Some respond quickly before stopping, allowing
												you to grow accustomed to sensations that don’t
												need constant monitoring, like the feeling of your
												clothes against your skin. Others are slow to stop
												signalling, so you remain aware of the sensation.

																	called ‘biological
																	catalysts’, and their
																	job is to speed up chemical
																	reactions. You are full of
																	dissolved chemicals with the
																	potential to come together or
																	break apart to form the
																	biological building blocks that
																	you need to stay alive, but the
																	reactions happen too slowly
																	on their own.
																	Enzymes are molecules
																	with ‘active sites’ that lock on
																	to other molecules, bringing
																	them close together so that
																	they can react, or bending
																	their structures so that they
																	can combine or break apart
																	more easily. The enzymes
																	themselves do not actually
																	get involved in the reactions;
																	they just help them to
																	happen faster.
																	Some of the most well-
																	known enzymes are the ones
																	in your digestive system. 
																	These are important for
																	breaking down the molecules
																	in your food. However, these
																	aren’t the only enzymes in
																	your body. There are others
																	responsible for building
																	molecules, snipping
																	molecules, tidying up when
																	molecules are no longer
																	needed, and even destroying
																	invading pathogens.

								<p style="text-align: justify;font-family:Bell MT;font-size:20px;width:300px;float:left"> Although the heart pumps
												oxygenated blood around the
												body, the heart’s muscular
												walls need their own blood supply.
												Oxygen-rich blood is delivered to these
												tissues via small vessels on its surface
												– the coronary arteries. These arteries
												can get narrowed or blocked up with
												cholesterol causing fatty plaques which
												slow blood fl ow. At times of exercise,
												not enough blood gets to the heart
												muscles, leading to pain due to lack of
												oxygen – angina. If a vessel becomes
												completely blocked, no blood gets
												through, causing a heart attack where
												the heart muscle dies.
												The first way to treat this type of
												coronary artery disease is with
												medicines. Secondly, angioplasty can
												be used, where narrowings in the
												arteries are stretched using a balloon,
												placing a stent to keep the vessel open.
												Finally, a heart bypass operation is an
												option for some patients.
												The surgeon uses healthy vessels
												from other parts of the patient’s body to
												bypass the blockage, allowing a new
												route for blood to flow. This delivers
												higher volumes of the oxygen-rich
												blood to the heart muscles beyond the
												blockage, preventing the pain.
												Most bypasses are performed by
												stopping the heart and using a
												heart-lung bypass machine to deliver
												oxygenated blood to the body. The new
												vessels are then sewn into place.
